title: retiring AI from dmanai repository
author: okay
---


if you've pulled from dmanai recently, you may have noticed more than a few
deletions.  i've decided to keep only AI i'm working on in the dmanai
repository, as users can host their AI on github and play against other github
repositories. 

this also makes sense because the AI on the ladder are being hosted in other
github repositories which are the definitive source of the AI.

thanks everyone for contributing, hopefully you won't run into many git merge
conflicts on the next pull ;-)
